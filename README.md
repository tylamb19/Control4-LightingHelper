# Lighting Helper

## Welcome to Lighting Helper, the perfect companion to Control4â€™s Gen3 Lighting Devices.

This driver allows you to add a list of devices to monitor for ambient lighting changes, as well as helpful programming commands, such as adjustments to backlight and status light curves, direct dimming and brightening of all LEDs, replacement of status LED colors, and more.

Ambient lighting monitoring is completed by first selecting your devices in the properties screen, then making the proper connections in the connections menu. A driver level variable will be created for each of the devices you selected in the properties window. This variable will be updated each time the light level is updated by the system, which is usually within 5 seconds of ambient light level changing. These variables can be used for all supported arithmetic comparisons in Control4 programming (equal to, greater than, not equal to, etc).
For wired keypads, you will need to also utilize the "Lighting Helper Wired Companion" driver, available here:
https://github.com/tylamb19/Control4-LightingHelperCompanion
This driver is necessary as the Control4 wired keypads do not report their device ID number when reporting an ambient light level change. For wired keypads, you will need to add your keypads via the Wired Keypads property, then run the "Add Wired Keypads" action which will add all needed companion drivers. Then make the necessary connections for each of the companion drivers (both the connection to the main Lighting Helper driver, and to the keypad in question).

**This driver is NOT endorsed or created by Control4. I am just a dealer and programmer who loves the product.**

### Installation

Head over to the releases page (https://github.com/tylamb19/Control4-LightingHelper/releases) and download the latest .c4z file. Add this driver to your Control4 system, and you should be good to go. The Lighting Helper Wired Companion driver (if needed) is located on its own releases page (https://github.com/tylamb19/Control4-LightingHelperCompanion/releases)
